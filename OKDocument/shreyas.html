        <h2 id="sub">Web Development<br>(HTML, CSS, JS)</h2>
        <ul id="text">
            <li>The Very First Module Of Our Fablab Was of Web Development Which Includes Understanding Of HTML, CSS And
                JS.</li>
            <li>Initially, we learnt all the basic tags of HTML along with some basic attributes of CSS. Tags like H1,
                Img, Form, etc were Used to get simple outputs.</li>
            <div class="flex">
                <img id="img" src="./Screenshot (46).png" alt="">
            </div>
            <li> For styling of the Web Page, we learnt various attributes of CSS such as font weight, text align,
                margin, flex, etc</li>
            <img id="img2" class="flex" src="./Screenshot (47).png" alt="">
            <li>After Understanding HTML And CSS, We Headed Towards JavaScript. Comparatively, JS Was A Difficult Task
                To Work On.</li>
            <li>We Learnt Declaring, Defining And Calling Of The Function In The JS. We Used JS In HTML Using /Script>
                Tag.</li>
            <img id="img3" class="flex" src="./Screenshot (48).png" alt="">
            <li>After All This, Our First Assignment Was To Make A Working Calculator Using HTML, CSS And JS. In This,
                Our Moderators Helped Us In All Our Difficulties. I Designed And Made A Working Calculator With The Help
                Of HTML, CSS And JS.</li>
            <a href="https://omkadu8767.github.io/Calculator/cal.html"><img id="img4" class="flex" src="./Screenshot (49).png"
                    alt="calci"></a>
            <li>Now, This Calculator Should Be Available To All. For This, Our Next Step Was To Upload Or Push My
                Calculator On Github. Github Is An Open-Source Platform That Provides Link To Our Website By Uploading
                Repositories.</li>
            <a href="https://github.com/omkadu8767"><img id="img5" class="flex" src="./Screenshot (50).png" alt="Github"></a>
            <li>Next Step Was To Make A Server Using JS. We Made A Working Server Of 9 Lines. We Installed A node.js
                Package From Internet. By Using node.js, We Doesn't Need To Restart The Server Again And Again.</li>
            <img id="img6" class="flex" src="./node.webp" alt="node">
            <li>After Acquiring Basic Knowledge About HTML, CSS And JS, Our Objective Was To Make A Personal Portfolio
                Website And Upload It To Github.</li>
            <a href="https://omkadu8767.github.io/NewPortofolio2/">
                <li>Click Here To See My Portfolio.</li>
